# Advent of Code

Thousands of programmers are undertaking the inaugural [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about); a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. These are my puzzle solutions.

My midnight workflow solely requires a browser to write JavaScript in the developer console.

## Notes

- **Day 1:** This'll be fun.
- **Day 2:** There's a leaderboard?
- **Day 3:** 89th!
- **Day 4:** Alerts can escape timed out tabs.
- **Day 5:** 81st!
- **Day 6:** Cache large datasets!
- **Day 7:** 90th!
- **Day 8:** Manipulate escaped literals before JavaScript interprets them. Lost nearly two hours there. What leaderboard?
- **Day 9:** We meet again Permutations. Back to back leaderboard omissions.
- **Day 10:** First time playing Look and Say.
- **Day 11:** That awkward moment your algorithm solves the input exorbitantly faster than the examples.
- **Day 12:** Recursion my old friend. 91st!
- **Day 13:** Oh Aldo. GCHQ next.
- **Day 14:** More JSON.
- **Day 15:** Efficiency plummets. Writing the solution was straightforward. Waiting for the numbers to crunch was exhausting. Pretty sure my limitations > JavaScript's limitations.
- **Day 16:** Deciphering the question was the bottleneck. I recorded my entire process. I'll edit and upload the recording and update this readme after a good night's rest.
