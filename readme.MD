# Advent of Code

Thousands of programmers are undertaking the inaugural [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about); a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. These are my puzzle solutions.

My midnight workflow solely requires a browser to refresh the new day's puzzle page (http://adventofcode.com/day/#) and write JavaScript in the developer console.

## Notes

- **Day 1:** This'll be fun.
- **Day 2:** There's a leaderboard?
- **Day 3:** 89th!
- **Day 4:** Alerts can escape timed out tabs.
- **Day 5:** 81st!
- **Day 6:** Cache large datasets!
- **Day 7:** 90th!
- **Day 8:** Manipulate escaped literals before JavaScript interprets them. Lost nearly two hours there. What leaderboard?
- **Day 9:** We meet again Permutations. Back to back leaderboard omissions.
